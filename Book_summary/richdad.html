    <h2>The Book in Three Sentences</h2>
    <ol>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rich Dad Poor Dad is about Robert Kiyosaki and his two dads—his real father (poor dad) and the father of his best friend (rich dad)—and the ways in which both men shaped his thoughts about money and investing.</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t need to earn a high income to be rich.</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rich people make money work </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">for</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> them.</span></li>
    </ol>
    <h2>The Five Big Ideas</h2>
    <ol>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The poor and the middle-class work for money. The rich have money work for them.</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not how much money you make that matters. It’s how much money you keep.</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rich people acquire assets. The poor and middle class acquire liabilities that they think are assets.</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial aptitude is what you do with money once you make it, how you keep people from taking it from you, how to keep it longer, and how you make money work hard for you.</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The single most powerful asset we all have is our mind.</span></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Rich Dad Poor Dad Summary</h2>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is a difference between being poor and being broke. Broke is temporary. Poor is eternal.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Money comes and goes, but if you have the education about how money works, you gain power over it and can begin building wealth.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People’s lives are forever controlled by two emotions: fear and greed.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So many people say, ‘Oh, I’m not interested in money.’ Yet they’ll work at a job for eight hours a day.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thinking that a job makes you secure is lying to yourself.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Intelligence solves problems and produces money.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You must know the difference between an asset and a liability, and buy assets.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An asset puts money in your pocket. A liability takes money out of your pocket.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Illiteracy, both in words and numbers, is the foundation of financial struggle.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Money often makes obvious our tragic human flaws, putting a spotlight on what we don’t know.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Cash flow tells the story of how a person handles money.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most people don’t understand why they struggle financially because they don’t understand cash flow.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The number-one expense for most people is taxes.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Higher incomes cause higher taxes. This is known as “bracket creep.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“More money seldom solves someone’s money problems.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The fear of being different prevents most people from seeking new ways to solve their problems.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A person can be highly educated, professionally successful, and financially illiterate.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Many financial problems are caused by trying to keep up with the Joneses.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you understand the difference between assets and liabilities, concentrate your efforts on buying income-generating assets.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The problem with simply working harder is that each of these three levels takes a greater share of your increased efforts. You need to learn how to have your increased efforts benefit you and your family directly.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wealth is a person’s ability to survive so many number of days forward—or, if I stopped working today, how long could I survive?”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The rich buy assets. The poor only have expenses. The middle class buy liabilities they think are assets.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The rich focus on their asset columns while everyone else focuses on their income statements.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Financial struggle is often directly the result of people working all their lives for someone else.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The mistake in becoming what you study is that too many people forget to mind their own business. They spend their lives minding someone else’s business and making that person rich.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To become financially secure, a person needs to mind their own business.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Financial struggle is often the result of people working all their lives for someone else.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The primary reason the majority of the poor and middle class are fiscally conservative—which means, ‘I can’t afford to take risks’—is that they have no financial foundation.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the main reasons net worth is not accurate is simply because, the moment you begin selling your assets, you are taxed for any gains.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A new car loses nearly 25 percent of the price you pay for it the moment you drive it off the lot.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Keep expenses low, reduce liabilities, and diligently build a base of solid assets.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Kiyosaki, real assets fall into the following categories:</span></p>
    <ol>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stocks</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bonds</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Income-generating real estate</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notes (IOUs)</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Royalties from intellectual property such as music, scripts, and patents</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anything else that has value, produces income or appreciates, and has a ready market</span></li>
    </ol>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Businesses that do not require my presence I own them, but they are managed or run by other people. If I have to work there, it’s not a business. It becomes my job.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For people who hate real estate, they shouldn’t buy it.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiyosaki generally holds real estate for less than seven years.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start minding your own business. Keep your daytime job, but start buying real assets, not liabilities.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Kiyosaki says mind your own business, he means building and keeping your asset column strong. Once a dollar goes into it, never let it come out.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The best thing about money is that it works 24 hours a day and can work for generations.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“An important distinction is that rich people buy luxuries last, while the poor and middle class tend to buy luxuries first.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A true luxury is a reward for investing in and developing a real asset.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiyosaki’s rich dad did not see Robin Hood as a hero. He called Robin Hood a crook.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you work for money, you give the power to your employer. If money works for you, you keep the power and control it.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Each dollar in my asset column was a great employee, working hard to make more employees and buy the boss a new Porsche.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiyosaki reminds people that financial IQ is made up of knowledge from four broad areas of expertise: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
    <ol>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accounting</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investing</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding markets</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law</span></li>
    </ol>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A corporation earns, spends everything it can, and is taxed on anything that is left. It’s one of the biggest legal tax loopholes that the rich use.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Garret Sutton’s books on corporations provide wonderful insight into the power of personal corporations.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Often in the real world, it’s not the smart who get ahead, but the bold.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiyosaki sees one thing in common in all of us, himself included. We all have tremendous potential, and we all are blessed with gifts. Yet the one thing that holds all of us back is some degree of self-doubt.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Kiyosaki’s personal experience, your financial genius requires both technical knowledges as well as courage.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiyosaki always encourages adult students to look at games as reflecting back to them what they know and what they need to learn.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Games reflect behavior. They are instant feedback systems.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Financial intelligence is simply having more options.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The single most powerful asset we all have is our mind. If it is trained well, it can create enormous wealth.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The world is always handing you opportunities of a lifetime, every day of your life, but all too often we fail to see them.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richard uses two main vehicles to achieve financial growth: real estate and small-cap stocks.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Simple math and common sense are all you need to do well financially.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The problem with ‘secure’ investments is that they are often sanitized, that is, made so safe that the gains are less.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is not gambling if you know what you’re doing. It is gambling if you’re just throwing money into a deal and praying.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most people never get wealthy simply because they are not trained financially to recognize opportunities right in front of them.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Great opportunities are not seen with your eyes. They are seen with your mind.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You want to know a little about a lot” was rich dad’s suggestion.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Job is an acronym for ‘Just Over Broke.’”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Look down the road at what skills they want to acquire before choosing a specific profession and before getting trapped in the Rat Race.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Education is more valuable than money, in the long run.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The reason so many talented people are poor is because they focus on building a better hamburger and know little to nothing about business systems.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main management skills needed for success are: </span></p>
    <ol>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Management of cash flow</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Management of systems</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Management of people</span></li>
    </ol>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The most important specialized skills are sales and marketing.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To be truly rich, we need to be able to give as well as to receive.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Giving money is the secret to most great wealthy families.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The primary difference between a rich person and a poor person is how they manage fear.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are five main reasons why financially literate people may still not develop abundant asset columns that could produce a large cash flow. The five reasons are:</span></p>
    <ol>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fear</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cynicism</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laziness</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bad habits</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arrogance</span></li>
    </ol>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For most people, the reason they don’t win financially is because the pain of losing money is far greater than the joy of being rich.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Failure inspires winners. Failure defeats losers.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Real estate is a powerful investment tool for anyone seeking financial independence or freedom.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A great property manager is key to success in real estate.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most common form of laziness is staying busy.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Rich dad believed that the words ‘I can’t afford it’ shut down your brain. ‘How can I afford it?’ opens up possibilities, excitement, and dreams.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whenever you find yourself avoiding something you know you should be doing, then the only thing to ask yourself is, ‘What’s in it for me?’ Be a little greedy. It’s the best cure for laziness.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richard has found that many people use arrogance to try to hide their own ignorance.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is gold everywhere. Most people are not trained to see it.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To find million-dollar ‘deals of a lifetime’ requires us to call on our financial genius.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A reason or a purpose is a combination of ‘wants’ and ‘don’t wants.’”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most people simply buy investments rather than first investing in learning about investing.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richard believes one of the hardest things about wealth-building is to be true to yourself and to be willing to not go along with the crowd.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The rich know that savings are only used to create more money, not to pay bills.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The sophisticated investor’s first question is: ‘How fast do I get my money back?’”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Richard could leave one single idea with you, it is that idea. Whenever you feel short or in need of something, give what you want first and it will come back in buckets.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the world of accounting, there are three different types of income: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
    <ol>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ordinary earned</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Portfolio</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Passive</span></li>
    </ol>
